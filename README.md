All the weights necessary to run the trained model are avaible at the following link:

You shoul download then unzipp and copy the folder in inference folder of the repository.

First you should use the make file of darknet to set up darknet (depending of your configuration).
Then, the following librairies need to be installed:
- openCV
- EasyGui
- numpy

Then to run these lines in the cmd
PATH_to_repo/inference/python python inference.py

For the labeling algorithm weights are availaible here:
